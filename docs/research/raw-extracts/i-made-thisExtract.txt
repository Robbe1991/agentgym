Hello everyone ![:winken:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f44b.png)It's been a week since we open-sourced Watchflow - its engine runs on GitHub events and uses LangGraph agents to reason over violations in pull requests, deployments, and more.It’s early-stage and not yet production-hardened, but it’s functional and already supports key use cases.We’re looking for contributors who have experience with LangGraph!Repo: <https://github.com/warestack/watchflow>

For anyone building RAG pipelines and yak-shaving over retrieval quality when the splitter keeps breaking context, I’ve released `Axonode-Chunker`.**What it does (and why it’s different)**\
• Scans the entire document first, then cuts where the embedding drift shows real topic shifts—so related paragraphs aren’t separated by page boundaries.\
• Lets you mark HOLD / RESUME, OPTIONAL\_CUT and NO\_CUT regions with regex patterns, keeping code blocks, tables or any layout you care about intact.\
• Learns an adaptive drift threshold per file, so you don’t have to retune between chatty e-mails and dense legal briefs.\
• Treats max/min token counts as guidelines; it will bend them rather than destroy coherence.\
• Preserves original page numbers on every chunk, making source citations trivial.Install with:

```
pip install axonode-chunker
```

GitHub  <https://github.com/bazilicum/axonode-chunker>\
PyPI   <https://pypi.org/project/axonode-chunker/>If you try it on your own corpus, I’d love to hear how it performs!

Hey!! I am working on a on-demand memory layer for LLMs, for many years I've been building chatbots and agents and everytime had to implement from scratch a memory layer, what I am working rn is more than a barely "all conversation messages attached to the prompt" or semantic RAG retrieval, as you might imagine RAG is quite unaccurate if you are looking for something specific, the solution I am working on uses a combination of NLP for coreference resolution and triplet extraction with GraphRAG to find ideally extactly what you are looking for (just for reference is quite the same thing google search uses to output search results) curious what are your ideas on this just because everyone is sharing a url here is the docs xD <https://brainapi.lumen-labs.ai/docs>

I’m excited to share my first robotics project, built for the Gemma 3N Hackathon:\
 **"Hi Robot meets Gemma – An Interactive Robotic System"** – inspired by the Hi-Robot paper.\
The system combines **Gemma3n** (offline, multimodal reasoning) with **SmolVLA** (real-time execution) so the robot can not only perform actions but also _explain its reasoning_ in both text and voice.\
**The twist?**\
 I used **LangSmith** for real-time performance profiling _inside_ a robotic workflow — something that traditionally relied on separate packages or behind-the-scenes logging. Seeing execution timing in one integrated view made optimization **so much smoother**. It showed me how LangSmith could be a game-changer for embodied AI systems.\
One limitation I ran into: I couldn’t visualize the **image inputs / or any input for this trace** in LangSmith. I am happy to chat more.\
 Being able to _see_ what the model was reasoning over (rather than just text logs) would have been incredibly powerful for robotics debugging and analysis.\

Hello everyone,im new to this community, i propose a new langchain vector store integration, a local mongo vector store : a lightweight, local vector store for standard Mongodb (community/free version) which could be used without Atlas or external software. Its meant to be something locally used and simple to use.Motivation\
i use mongodb for app data, people want embeddings and metadata in the same db without using Atlas vector search as it is not completely free\
something useful is needed for local and privacy work\
even if performance lags behind FAISS/Qdrant on large data stores, this enables an easy migration path and a single db useAPI\
a method to store/upload text ,data, metadata and embedding vectors\
a method for similarity search on a query for some top n data\
a method to parse some pdf or txt files and semantically chunk the most relevant data together\
Some more features can be added in the futureFAISS/Qdrant can be used for production or >100k vectors,this feature is primarily for local convenience or smaller data.Would this be a good feature for langchain , i would like to contribute and would love to work on this with others if this is a worthy project.

Hi everyone!I’m Muhammad Saad, a Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor working with mentors from Google DeepMind on the project "Enhancing Gemini API Integrations in OSS Agent Tools." My work focuses on advancing Gemini API integration in LangChain by adding dedicated support for structured output, improving tool calling and code execution features, and providing clear documentation with hands-on example workflows. I’m excited to share that I’ve had 13 PRs merged so far and am now the top contributor to the project! ![:partygesicht:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f973.png)Today, I'm excited to share two new LangChain workflows:

* **Grounded Search Agent**: Combines real-time Google Search with PDF analysis for comprehensive research.
* **Code Executing Chatbot**: Enables dynamic Python code execution and multi-turn data analysis with visualization.

You can find the workflows and details in my public repo: [gsoc-workflows](https://github.com/msaadg/gsoc-workflows) ![:rakete:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f680.png)\
I’d love your feedback, suggestions, and any ideas for further improvements. If you try out the workflows, let me know how they work for you or if you spot any issues. Your input will help shape the final deliverables and documentation!Thanks for your support and looking forward to your thoughts! ![:leichtes\_lächeln:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f642.png)

Recently LangChain published the [Ambient Agents](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/ambient-agents/) course. It's a really great introduction to LangGraph, and builds up an email assistant step by step. Really useful to know but all in Python.

Greetings ans salutations, everyone!I'm Scott. Just some guy with a computer that likes to build stuff.I built a Persistent Mind Model (PMM) so you can train & evolve a personalized AI — and take it anywhere: across sessions, models (GPT, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral), even devices — with all memories & commitments intact because most AI “personalities” vanish when you switch models or devices.You could think of it as your very own personal AI Tamagotchi.You tell it what to think, how to think, and it learns and develops through its interactions and recursive, self-referential reflections over time, and works with LangChain for orchestration; the PMM stores the persona and its memory as portable, verifiable JSON.The best part? It’s fully portable. APIs or local LLMs simply serve as a substrate engine for its development.Its long-term operability is 100% decoupled from third-party vendors.I would really love some feedback from this community.Thoughts?[You can check it out here.](https://github.com/scottonanski/persistent-mind-model)

Hi everyone! I am building an app for no-code users to quickly spin up AI agents and assign tools, knowledge, memory, etc... Then users can build agent teams to automate workflows. It is a work in progress but coming along great! I am looking for some early beta users that can test and give feedback. I am also building it solo currently and would love to find another good dev or two that might want to hop on board and help get it over the finish line.  Here is the site, simply request access and I will send an invite code.

Hi Everyone,We have recently launched an open-source memory solution for AI Agents called [Memori](https://github.com/GibsonAI/memori). I created an integration example with LangChain today, tested how it works and result is truly great!Check out the integration example in our GitHub repo - it’s surprisingly simple to implement: <https://github.com/GibsonAI/memori/blob/main/examples/integrations/langchain_example.py>\
Here is a short demo of it: <https://x.com/BoburUmurzokov/status/1955944250547351596>I’d love feedback from the community.  If you find it useful, please star the repo to help more devs discover Memori. Thanks!

Hey guys, I created a **patch driver for LLMs to let them modify big documents with patches** (both structured and unstructured). Something like ‘_trustcall_’ but works both for strings (like legal docs, codebases, etc) and JSONs. Also I was focused on building something framework-agnostic and scalable for more patch types (XML, images, etc.)<https://github.com/NickSherrow/llm_patch_driver>I would really appreciate if you **star and share my repo**. Pull requests are welcome: it needs more ApiAdapter, more patch types, and some optimization.

Hello everyone ![:winken:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f44b.png) Loving all the projects being shared here! Excited to add mine to the list.\
Over the past year, I’ve been building agents, and out of that journey came **Promptius AI** — an agent that builds production-grade AI agents, exportable as LangChain and LangGraph code.\
The idea came from necessity: while no-code/drag-and-drop tools are great, as a developer I wanted full transparency and control — from how LLMs are prompted to how state is managed across graphs, subgraphs, and structured outputs with Pydantic models. It should feel like writing AI-native software.\
But here’s the challenge: even developers struggle with frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph. The learning curve is steep, and many teams simply don’t have the bandwidth to explore. Promptius makes these frameworks accessible — while keeping the flexibility developers love.\
![:blitzschnell:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/26a1.png) To speed up prototyping, we also include an **evaluation pipeline** that tests agents before handing them over to you.\
 ![:stecker:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f50c.png) And with seamless integration to **10,000+ agent skills via Composio**, you can connect your agents to real-world actions instantly.\

Hey everyone,Handling concurrent interrupts with human-in-the-loop (hilt) is not trivial, so I built a minimal LangGraph ReAct agent to demonstrate it:- Each worker/tool executes its action and then pauses with \`interrupt()\`, waiting for human input (accept, edit, or reject)\
\- The \`resume()\` method allows resolving one or a batch of interrupts out of order\
\- Once all workers complete, the agent produces a single consolidated responseI'm working on adapting the front-end to support this. Will share it soon.\

Hey everyone! [#i-made-this](https://langchaincommunity.slack.com/archives/C079U7CRJR2) [#i-read-this](https://langchaincommunity.slack.com/archives/C06BRDE7UF7)I’m on a mission to really learn LangChain and eventually become an engineer who uses it daily in their job. I already have a strong base in SQL, Python, and scripting, but I know that to get good at LangChain I need to go beyond theory.That’s why I’d love it if people here who build something — big or small — could share a complete doc + working prototype. It helps learners like me study how things fit together, re-create the flow, and truly understand the “why” behind the build.I’m here not just to watch but to participate, share back my learnings, and hopefully collaborate with some of you along the way. Every shared experiment makes all of us better

I’ve been working on a **retrieval firewall** for RAG pipelines.\
Instead of filtering LLM outputs, it scans _retrieved chunks before they hit the model_:\
 – auto-deny prompt injection & secret leaks\
 – flag/rerank PII, encoded blobs, and unapproved URLs\
 – YAML policies + JSONL audit logs\
Works as a drop-in wrapper for LangChain retrievers:

```
from rag_firewall import Firewall, wrap_retriever  
fw = Firewall.from_yaml("firewall.yaml")  
safe = wrap_retriever(base_retriever, firewall=fw)  
docs = safe.get_relevant_documents("What is our mission?")  
```

OSS, Apache-2.0: <https://github.com/taladari/rag-firewall>\
Would love feedback — especially if you’ve seen real-world prompt injections or retrieval poisoning we should test against.

Getting structured JSON from small language models (SLMs) can be a real challenge. It's far more natural for them to generate a simple query like this:\
"show name, price where price < 20"\
...than a verbose JSON object like this:\`\`\`\
{\
 "command": {\
  "type": "filter",\
  "select": "name, rollno",\
  "condition": {\
   "column": "age",\
   "operator": ">",\
   "value": 25\
  }\
 }\
}\
\`\`\`So, I built a new app to explore a more natural way to get structured data from SLMs (1.7b model), right in your browser!𝐌𝐲 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥'𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦:\
𝐆𝐮𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫: I feed the SLM a system prompt containing a formal grammar (using EBNF/Lark). This nudges the model to produce output that follows a predictable, text-based structure like the first example.\
𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭: A custom output parser, built with Lark and running in Pyodide, then easily transforms this structured text into a developer-friendly format like JSON.This entire pipeline runs client-side in browser thanks to an awesome tech stack:\
𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥: Qwen3-1.7b (q4f16)\
𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞: MLC's WebLLM engine for in-browser inference\
𝐑𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞: **[LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)**’s LangGraph Web\

Progress !  Full local deploy of a Open Agent Platform,  production capable, - next step deploy to GCP/ CloudRun for a containerized Langconnect RAG server and Langgraph for both Supervisor Agent and SubAgents. Flex App Engine for the next.js webapp you can see here.  Uses Supabase, Arcade for MCP Sub Agent Tools select and use as the SubAgents sees fit.  Langsmith all sewn in of course and can choose use of own LLM API keys. Client Stellantis - MOPAR/Chrysler - RAM.Create account.. logon and enter your Vehicle make, model year and trim and miles..  Create new subagents first..3 or 4 clicks - edit pre-presented prompt - kick off Engineer Sub-Agents( Tools & RAG doc access for all subAgents) essentially specialized Technicians for Engine,brakes,transmission,electrical and the Supervisor Agent( akin to a Dealer Service Manager).. but a decent ROI % cheaper than a visit to a Dealer.. in time and Hour charges for diagnostics.AI Tech Engineer specialists that have access to your own Service documents/build sheet/old pdf invoices of work done.. etc..    are less likely to up-sell you or bait you in for more billable diagnostics.  You can even ask the Agents to go shopping for parts, itteratively.Working on long term memory secured- b/e Postgre - or similar..  prob use langgraph platform store class for each Customer signup/login/ email as tuple.. and session saves...  so each login will enable Agents to draw from prior sessions memory but with a toggle switch to be added for Erase of long term.. embeddings  to use the semantic or sequential search memory feature to be used .. method of Store.   more cost but a feature if Customer wishes to utilize via toggle. (bearbeitet)

Smart enough to give me Ohm meter ranges for each diesel cummins injector posts - to detect any failing injector AND to indicate that a errant Chassis 'trouble code' in a EMU sub module can indicate a short in the license plate bulb area that can throw a sensor in the transfer case shift motor(the nearest sensor to the rear of the chassis)... ie it points to red herrings... savings 1000$s.ie..  Humanoid.. won't have to pay 400$ for a new xfer case Shift motor.. the sensor over voltage could be due to a 12V short in the license plate area(vibration caused).. and indeed that was the case... fix cost.. 0$ ( self inspection and find and tape up chaffed wire). (bearbeitet)

Hi All,\

 ![:umarmendes\_gesicht:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f917.png) <https://huggingface.co/neeraj-kumar-47/aibastion-prompt-injection-jailbreak-detector>\
![:rundumleuchte:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f6a8.png) The threat isn’t just what AI can do — it’s how attackers hijack it with prompt injections & jailbreaks.\
I’ve fine-tuned **AI Bastion: Prompt Injection & Jailbreak Detector**, a guardrail model that is:\
 ![:weißes\_häkchen:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/2705.png) Lightweight – Runs on laptops, no GPU needed\

 ![:schild:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f6e1-fe0f.png) Robust – Trained on diverse adversarial attacks (encoding, persona abuse, obfuscation, tool misuse)\
 ![:balkendiagramm:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4ca.png) Accurate – Tested with 98%+ performance (F1 = 0.9896, Precision = 0.9836, Recall = 0.9956)\
Please check it out and share your thoughts — your feedback will be very valuable.

 ![:link:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f517.png) <https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7371055720672366593/>\
![:schild:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f6e1-fe0f.png) **AI Bastion: Prompt Injection & Jailbreak Detector** is my fine-tuned guardrail model for GenAI apps.\
The video shows how it:\
 ![:weißes\_häkchen:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/2705.png) Detects harmful prompts (injections, jailbreaks, abuse) before they reach your LLMs\
 ![:vorhängeschloss:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f512.png) Lets harmless prompts pass safely, preserving usability\
 ![:blitzschnell:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/26a1.png) Runs lightweight on laptops — no GPU required\
 ![:balkendiagramm:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4ca.png) Achieves 98%+ accuracy on test data\
Please take a look, and let me know what you think — I’d love your feedback.

![:glühbirne:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4a1.png)Want ad-ready images without designers? Let me show you my NanoBanana Workflow in n8n that makes it happen in seconds.![:nach\_rechts\_zeigen:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f449.png)This workflow automatically takes an image, analyzes it, and generates a professional ad-ready version using AI. Let’s walk through how it works.![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Step 1 – Form Trigger\
 “We start with a simple form trigger. Here, I can upload an image and give it a short description. This kicks off the entire workflow.”![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Step 2 – Upload to Google Drive\
 “Next, the workflow uploads that image to Google Drive. This makes the file accessible for the next AI steps.”![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Step 3 – AI Image Analysis\
 “Then, the image is analyzed using OpenAI’s vision model. It checks whether the picture is mainly a product, a character, or both, and describes the visual details in structured YAML format.”![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Step 4 – Prompt Generation\
 “Based on that analysis, another AI agent creates a short and natural image prompt. This prompt is carefully designed for ad use, making sure the product looks authentic, the text stays accurate, and the style feels realistic—like a genuine ad photo.”![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Step 5 – Structured Parsing\
 “To keep things consistent, the prompt is passed through a structured parser. This ensures the final text is clean and ready to use.”![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Step 6 – Image Generation via OpenRouter\
 “Now comes the fun part! The workflow sends both the original image and the AI-generated prompt to the OpenRouter API, which calls Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model. This generates a brand new ad-style image.”![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Step 7 – File Conversion & Save\
 “The generated image data is processed, converted into a file, and stored. So at the end, I get a ready-to-use ad image that matches my original product shot, but looks polished for marketing.”![:nach\_rechts\_zeigen:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f449.png)drop “ad-ready” in the comments to get the file

 My team and I at Forter are working on [Trusted Agentic Commerce Protocol (TACP)](https://github.com/forter/trusted-agentic-commerce-protocol) - an open standard for how agents can safely interact with commerce flows (checkout, payments, accounts, etc.).\
I think it could be relevant for LangChain builders working with tool-driven, multi-step agents. I’m planning to share a LangChain example using the protocol soon — would love feedback or contributions from the community.\

To answer tough tax and compliance questions, you need an AI that can think. An agent that can create a plan, execute it, and validate its own findings.\
So I built one.\

Hi all. I wanted a suggestion if anyone has built anything like this. My kids go for supplementary math classes and they have weekly homework that I need to submit every week.

Do any of you have pointers on or have done something similar that I can replicate or have suggestions?

Hi everyone! I’m super excited to share **DentalDesk** – a toy project I built using **LangChain + LangGraph**. It’s a WhatsApp chatbot for dental clinics where patients can book or reschedule appointments, register as new patients, and get answers to some FAQs — with **persistent memory** so the conversation stays contextual. I separated the agent logic from the business tools (via an MCP server), which makes it easy to extend and play around with.

Hey everyone! I am building [AffinityBots](https://affinitybots.com/), an AI app that allows no-code users to quickly create and manage optimized AI agents. It utilizes a self-hosted Langgraph Platform on the backend.  Users can create multiple agents, i.e. Researcher, Content Creator, Social Media Expert, Etc... and utilize them to build multi-agent collaborative workflows. User can easily add tools (Search, Notion, Github, Supabase, Etc...) and a knowledgebase for better context. The agents have built-in long-term memory that allows the agent to learn and improve as it executes workflows.  Each agent can take in different tools and knowledge, give your DB agent just your SOP's or technical data and give your content creation agent your business description and style guide. The app is basically an AI first n8n with additional features. No need to build out 15 different nodes to do 2 things, with AffinityBots you can literally create two nodes (AI tasks) to do the exact same thing.  We do not have all the integrations they do, yet, but we'll get there. The app is a work in progress and has some bugs for sure but I think it has massive potential.The app is in early beta and I am looking for users to test it out for FREE.  If you are interested, head to [https://affinitybots.com](https://affinitybots.com/) and request access.   I am also looking to build a team, it is just me currently and I know I am going to need help to build and grow it with users. I am unable to pay anything, however, the app or business is incorporated and ready for funding and I am willing to negotiate equity in the company. Once funded I can pay salaries. Please DM me if you are interested. Thanks! (bearbeitet)

I’ve recently worked on an exciting project that involved building a chatbot with Streamlit UI and Short-Term Memory capabilities, powered by LangGraph. This chatbot doesn’t just provide natural language responses using an advanced language model but also integrates with various tools to enhance its functionality.\
![:schraubenschlüssel:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f527.png) Key Features:

1. Numerical Calculations – The chatbot can perform complex calculations in real-time. Whether it's basic arithmetic or more advanced math, it's got you covered. ![:glühbirne:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4a1.png)
2. Internet Search – By integrating with the DuckDuckGo search engine, it fetches real-time data from the web, making it your intelligent assistant for queries. ![:globus\_mit\_meridianen:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f310.png)
3. Stock Price Tool – Just provide the name of a company, and the bot retrieves the live stock price instantly. ![:diagramm\_aufwärtstrend:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4c8.png)

All of this is powered by SQLite for data persistence, Streaming for smooth interactions, and LangGraph to seamlessly integrate these capabilities into the chatbot. LangGraph made it much easier to handle tool integrations and memory management within the model. ![:pfeile\_gegen\_uhrzeigersinn:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f504.png)

Sarfraz Ali  [14:18 Uhr](https://langchaincommunity.slack.com/archives/C079U7CRJR2/p1758889138672319)

I’ve developed an automated blog generation system that takes a simple topic and transforms it into a full-length blog post, using a two-step process powered by LangGraph. ![:roboter:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f916.png)![:funkelnde\_sterne:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/2728.png)\
**How it Works:**\
**Step 1: Generate Outline&#xA0;****![:memo:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4dd.png)**\
 The workflow first takes the topic provided by the user and generates a detailed blog outline. This helps structure the content by breaking it down into key sections.\
**Step 2: Generate Blog Content&#xA0;****![:federhalter\_links\_unten:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f58b-fe0f.png)**\
 With the outline in hand, the system then uses it to generate a detailed blog post, ensuring each section of the outline is fully fleshed out into a coherent and informative blog.**LangGraph Workflow Design:**\
The workflow is built with LangGraph and consists of two primary nodes: ![:schraubenschlüssel:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f527.png)\
**Node 1: Create Outline&#xA0;****![:klemmbrett:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cb.png)**\
 **Functionality:** This node takes the user-provided topic and uses it to generate a structured outline for the blog. The model understands the topic and breaks it down into key points and sub-topics.\
**Node 2: Create Blog Content&#xA0;****![:kugelschreiber\_links\_unten:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f58a-fe0f.png)**\
 **Functionality:** This node takes the topic and the outline and generates a full-length blog based on the outline. It ensures the content is well-organized and aligned with the initial structure, providing a comprehensive blog post.**Key Features:**

* **Efficient Workflow&#xA0;****![:rakete:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f680.png)****:** Seamlessly moves from generating a structured outline to creating a detailed blog.
* **Node-based Process&#xA0;****![:zahnrad:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/2699-fe0f.png)****:** Clear and easy-to-understand flow with specific functionalities for each node.
* **Real-Time Streaming&#xA0;****![:stoppuhr:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/23f1-fe0f.png)****:** The content is streamed progressively to the user, ensuring a dynamic and engaging experience.

This system showcases the power of LangGraph in structuring complex workflows for content generation, allowing for automation and efficiency in content creation. ![:stern2:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f31f.png)\

![:rakete:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f680.png) Building Smarter Customer Review Workflows with LangGraph + LLMs\
Handling customer reviews isn’t just about responding quickly—it’s about responding intelligently. Some reviews are full of praise ![:erhobene\_hände:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f64c.png), while others highlight real frustrations ![:triumph:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f624.png). Both deserve thoughtful, tailored responses.\
I recently built a workflow using LangGraph + OpenAI models that automates this process end-to-end:\
![:raute\_blau\_klein:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f539.png) Step 1: Sentiment DetectionThe system first identifies whether the review is positive or negative.\
![:raute\_blau\_klein:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f539.png) Step 2a: Positive ReviewsIf it’s positive, the LLM crafts a warm thank-you message and encourages the customer to leave feedback on our website.\
![:raute\_blau\_klein:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f539.png) Step 2b: Negative ReviewsIf it’s negative, the system runs a diagnosis layer, extracting:

1. Issue type (UX, Bug, Performance, etc.)
2. Tone (angry, calm, frustrated…)
3. Urgency (low, medium, high)

Using these insights, the LLM generates an empathetic, problem-solving reply that matches the user’s sentiment and urgency.\
![:glühbirne:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4a1.png) The result? A workflow that not only saves time but also elevates customer experience by ensuring responses are context-aware and personalized.

**Exploring MCP Model Context Protocol, Client-Server Architecture.&#xA0;****![:computer:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4bb.png)****![:lupe:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f50d.png)**\
Today, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its practical applications with Claude Desktop. As part of my learning, I explored the dynamics between client and server in system interactions. ![:pfeile\_gegen\_uhrzeigersinn:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f504.png)\
![:raute\_blau\_klein:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f539.png) Client-Server Architecture:\
In this setup, Claude Desktop acted as the client ![:desktop-computer:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f5a5-fe0f.png), requesting data and services, while my file system served as the server ![:aktenschrank:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f5c4-fe0f.png), providing the resources requested. This separation of roles allowed me to better understand how systems communicate and work together to achieve specific tasks.\
![:raute\_blau\_klein:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f539.png) Practical Task:\
With just a simple command to Claude Desktop, I automated the creation of a folder named "sarfraz-python" ![:offener\_ordner:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4c2.png) on my desktop, and it automatically created a Python script, "[sa.py](http://sa.py/)"![:schlange:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f40d.png), which, when executed, prints the name "Sarfraz." Here’s a quick overview of the process:\
1\. Issued a command to Claude Desktop to create the folder and Python script automatically. ![:sprechende\_silhouette:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f5e3-fe0f.png)\
2\. The script was generated to output the name "Sarfraz" upon execution. ![:funkelnde\_sterne:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/2728.png)\
3\. Everything was seamlessly executed by Claude without manual intervention. ![:rakete:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f680.png)\
This experience not only enhanced my understanding of client-server communication but also demonstrated how powerful automation tools like Claude Desktop can simplify tasks like directory creation and script execution. ![:roboter:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f916.png)![:schraubenschlüssel:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f527.png)\
I’m excited to continue exploring MCP, client-server systems, and how Python can be used to automate real-world tasks. The journey of learning never stops! ![:sämling:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f331.png)![:bücher:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4da.png)\

I’ve been working on an exciting project where I leveraged n8n to automate form submissions, trigger data updates, and enrich records dynamically. This powerful automation workflow seamlessly integrates multiple nodes, transforming how data flows through Airtable.![:reißzwecke:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4cc.png) Here’s a Breakdown of the Workflow:Trigger Node: Form Submission ![:memo:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4dd.png)\
The process starts with a form submission, capturing user data like Name, Looks, and Profession (such as Video Editor, Graphic Designer, AI Manager). The form data is gathered from a user-friendly form URL.Create Record in Airtable ![:balkendiagramm:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4ca.png)\
The submitted form data is automatically mapped and sent to Airtable to create a record in a specified base and table.Routing with Switch Node ![:pfeile\_gewunden\_nach\_rechts:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f500.png)\
Depending on the Profession selected in the form, the workflow routes the data into different branches for further processing:\
Video Editor\
Graphic Designer\
AI ManagerPoetry Generation with Google Gemini Chat model ![:roboter:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f916.png)![:schreibende\_hand:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/270d-fe0f.png)\
For a touch of creativity, I’ve added an AI-based poetry generation node that crafts simple, beautiful poems based on the submitted form data! ![:stern2:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f31f.png)Updating Airtable Record ![:pfeile\_gegen\_uhrzeigersinn:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f504.png)\
Once the poem is generated, the Airtable record is updated with the poem, ensuring a smooth flow of information.

Hi everyone! Want to share something super exciting! And yes I have a demo you can play with!I wrote a specification protocol (just like A2A/MCP/AGUI), which I am calling the Agentic Human-In-The-Loop protocol!TLDR: Have you noticed how agents are not great at taking feedback/input for humans? When you start on cursor, and the agent build mode asks you bulleted questions with multiple choices, which are supposed to be answered strategically to ensure the agent understands that x is the answer to q1. That's not how the agentic world will scale. I face a similar issue at promptius, there is no standard way how agents can put their requirements to users.AHITL solves that, agents can now generate structured forms to ask questions to the users!I built a playground for anyone to try it out: [AHITL demo](https://promptius.ai/ahitl-agent)\
The spec protocol document: [AHITL specification](https://promptius.ai/ahitl-spec)\

To streamline our feedback management process, we’ve introduced an AI-powered framework designed to reduce manual workloads and improve response times, driving overall operational efficiency. ![:aktentasche:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4bc.png)![:funkelnde\_sterne:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/2728.png)Objective:\
Our goal is to simplify the feedback process by automatically analyzing, categorizing, and directing feedback to the appropriate department for swift resolution. ![:darts:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f3af.png)How It Works:1. Feedback Submission: Customers submit their feedback via a form. ![:memo:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4dd.png)\
2\. AI Analysis: The AI agent analyzes the feedback, classifying it as a complaint, compliment, or feature request. ![:roboter:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f916.png)\
3\. Routing & Notifications:\
![:pfeile\_gegen\_uhrzeigersinn:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f504.png)Complaints are forwarded directly to the relevant department for resolution. ![:rundumleuchte:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f6a8.png)\
![:pfeile\_gegen\_uhrzeigersinn:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f504.png) Feature requests are sent to the appropriate team for review. ![:glühbirne:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4a1.png)\
![:pfeile\_gegen\_uhrzeigersinn:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f504.png) Compliments are routed to management. ![:stern2:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f31f.png)\
4\. Customer Communication: If the feedback is negative or includes a complaint, the customer is automatically notified via email. ![:e-mail:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4e7.png)\
5\. Team Collaboration: The relevant team is instantly notified, ensuring a timely response and resolution. ![:pfeile\_gegen\_uhrzeigersinn:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f504.png)Expected Impact\
This AI-driven approach will enable faster feedback processing, improved customer experience, and more efficient team collaboration. By automating these processes, we empower our teams to focus on what truly matters—driving innovation and customer satisfaction. ![:rakete:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f680.png)\

I’ve been spending a lot of time recently on a new project that sits at the intersection of **AI agents**, **developer tools**, and **code automation**.\
We’re building an **autocoding system** that can _write, refactor, and push code autonomously_, with native **GitHub/GitLab** integration — powered by agentic workflows.\
Right now, we’re in **Phase 1**, which involves:

Hey all ![:winken:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f44b.png)  I  wanted to share something I've been working on for the last few weeks. I'm a product manager who has recently changed roles to an AI Adoption Engineer at a blockchain company and what started off as a codex clone to help me manage more agents on different repos at the same time, I've built an agent development environment to create LangGraph workflows and build custom agent nodes. _Fair warning&#xA0;_- I am not a software dev by any means and have only been coding with Ai agents for 3 months, so you might see things that make you scratch your head on why I would do such a thing ![:leichtes\_lächeln:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f642.png)I got a bit obsessed with RAG and multi-agent systems after reading every huggingface paper I could find on contextual engineering and agentic AI. I had the image creating and storing agent workflows in my head as if it were an RPG videogame where you could save loadouts and depending on what task was at hand, you could have a loadout ready for it to swap to at any moment. As I work in the Blockchain/Defi/Gaming world, this seemed like something that would resonate with my company and get people engaged to want to learn more about agentic Ai.The core of my platform is the Agent Workflow Creator and Agent Builder. There is a RAG system with a pgvector db that runs throughout the platform and all agents can access it if needed, as well as behavioral learning from failed tasks, or rejected code. There's also an AI Agent who is embedded in the platform and can help users create/design their agent workflows, or help them with other features/systems within the platform.You can link a github/gitlab account to connect and manage your repositories. Send agents on tasks from your project's page, whether a single task, or a directive which is where the agent plans a series of tasks to complete a larger request, and you're able to monitor the progress.Switch into "Focus Mode" to launch an IDE with an integrating coding agent and a few other tools to be more hands on with your codebase. You're able to build out the workflow in the visualizer and it populates the LangGraph code for you to take to your own project. Another feature I'm working on is an easy few button deployment of the workflow in a test environment, or have it launch the IDE and coding agent who will take the LangGraph code and help implement it into your repo, or a standalone script to execute the workflow.There's quite a few other features and other bits I'll mention another time, as well as an extensive backlog of enhancements, but I'm looking to refine a lot of the core functionality and will begin testing it with a few coworkers to see if we're able to generate functional flows and processes from start to finish.It's still a major WIP and my bug list keeps growing, but here are a few screenshots and a video of myself navigating some of the features and testing the coding agent in the IDE. Would love any comments/feedback or if you know some amazing resources for building agentic AI or context handling, I'd love to see it! Excited to be here and thank you all ![:lächeln:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f604.png)

Hey guys!! I have a question for you... I recently built a RAG application. The topic is a bit complex — it’s about the _São Paulo City Council_, some laws, and other boring information. It has memory persistence; I send the last three interactions with each call, and the retriever’s FAISS top-K is 6. The average number of tokens per call is around 6000. Do you think that’s an absurd number, or is it acceptable for an architecture like this?

Hey everyone ![:winken:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f44b.png)I’ve been experimenting with **LangChain + Slack Bolt + pgvector**, and built a small side project called **VecBrain** — an AI agent that helps teams **find answers from their own Slack history**.It indexes past messages from selected channels and answers questions with full context (author, timestamp, and link to the original message) — no hallucinations.Here’s a quick example:

> Q: _“What color was agreed for the hero graphics?”_\
> A: _“The agreed color is a new purple gradient — see Grace’s message \[here].”_

Repo and demo coming soon — would love feedback from anyone working on RAG-based Slack or internal knowledge tools!

well.. lets see if I can use any existing between thread/ ie postgre long term memory/semantic searches via  langgraph's meta agent graphs.me thinks that they dont permit use at that level of the API to use 'Store' and Checkpointer classes & methods.  ie the Supervisor-Agent and Sub-Agent-- tools/MCP & RAG. Agent frames do not have such a feature (currently) (bearbeitet)

Hello Everyone, I am trying to run open deep research using langchain and language graph. It's running from lang graph studio, but when running from api/postman, it's giving me below error. What details need to be sent in the Authorization header ? Is it langsmith api key or any other details ? Thanks.

Hey everyone! I am trying to get used to our codebase's LangGraph setup. The configuration doesn't belong to me and there are some obstacles that I am not familiar with because I am pretty new to LangGraph. So, I'd love to get help from the community. The thing is that I am tryin to visualize the graph on LangSmith however, apparently our LangGraph setup has some custom configuration considering the above error message:

```
ValueError: Heads up! Your graph '...' from 'some/path/in/project/folder.py' includes a custom checkpointer (type <class 'langgraph.checkpoint.memory.InMemorySaver'>). With LangGraph API, persistence is handled automatically by the platform, so providing a custom checkpointer (type <class 'langgraph.checkpoint.memory.InMemorySaver'>) here isn't necessary and will be ignored when deployed.
```

Does that mean I need to change the configuration for good to be able to visualize the flow on LangSmith? Or is there a way to use LangSmith with the current setup without affecting the project's existing settings? (bearbeitet)

Hello everyone!\
While language may not be a barrier for LLMs, it can sometimes be a barrier in countries where English isn't the primary language.\
When utilizing a great framework like LangChain, the “English” documentation can sometimes feel like a barrier to developers in South Korea.\
I have localized all LangChain v1.0 documentation(thx to GPT) into Korean and made it available to help minimize this barrier for all developers in South Korea.I translated about 2,000 MDX files. After LLM translation, there were various errors like syntax and linking issues, but I handled each exception case one by one. After two full days, I achieved a pretty satisfying result.Below is the Korean LangChain V1.0 documentation.\
[https://kr.langchain-docs.com](https://kr.langchain-docs.com/)I intentionally set it to ‘kr’ as a sub-domain.\
If there are others interested in translation from other countries like me, it would be great if various countries besides ‘kr’ could be added.Alternatively, it would be nice if multiple translations were integrated into the official LangChain documentation later!Thx, have a great day!

Stop Building Unpredictable AI Agents for Booking SystemsLast year, everyone rushed to build booking bots using pure AI agents.The results?

Seeking your feedback on a project I am working on. This project cannot be completed without your feedback.\
The key idea is to standardize the analytics data schema in order to make it easy to prove ROI for AI agents and understand user behavior.\
With the standardization, the analytics implementation becomes interoperable and comparable across different projects.

* [The proposed specification](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/discussions/6476) for the tracking data schema (the analytics data to collect from the AI Agent)
* [The implementation guide](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/ai-product-analytics-privacy/) covering examples that covers the setup code, dashboard sample, and SQL queries to extract key metrics

Just pushed a new LangChain integration for GenOps AI:  <https://github.com/KoshiHQ/GenOps-AI/tree/main/examples/langchain>GenOps AI is an open-source runtime governance framework built on OpenTelemetry. It lets you capture usage, cost, and policy telemetry directly from your LangChain apps. Supports multi-model workloads as well.Would love feedback from anyone exploring governance for LLM workflows.

Hi, I wrote a long step-by-step guide on how open deep research works under the hood. I cover the design patterns used there and show how the state of every agent and sub-agent changes at every step of the execution.\
Looking forward to your feedback ![:beten:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f64f.png)\

Hey folks, I'm building [Lenzy AI](https://lenzy.ai/) - probably the first product analytics platform for AI agents.Lenzy analyzes your AI chat logs to surface actionable insights: What features are users requesting? Where do they get frustrated? What makes them churn? (Or any other custom question)Unlike observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, Langsmith) that help you monitor and debug agent performance, Lenzy helps you understand user needs and improve your product.Contact me for early access with early adopter perks!
