# Updated Validation Timeline - Credibility-First Approach

## 🎯 Strategic Shift

**OLD PLAN:**
- Week 1: Send cold DMs → 2-3 interviews
- Week 2-4: More interviews, validate
- Decision: Go/No-Go

**NEW PLAN (Credibility-First):**
- Week 1: Build AgentEval + Community Presence
- Week 2: Launch AgentEval → Establish Credibility
- Week 3-4: Send credible DMs → 8-12 interviews
- Decision: Go/No-Go (same deadline, better data)

**Why Change:**
- ✅ 3-4x better response rate (30-40% vs 10-15%)
- ✅ Higher quality conversations (they trust you)
- ✅ Foundation for AgentGym launch
- ⚠️ Only 1 week delay to first interviews

Hey everyone! 👋

Spent the last week building AgentEval - an open-source tool to
benchmark AI agent quality.

🎯 What it does:
- Tests your agent across 5 quality dimensions
- Detects common failure modes (loops, hallucinations, etc.)
- Generates a simple report card
- Works with LangChain, LangGraph, any framework

💡 Why I built it:
While working on RL-based agent training, I realized measuring
quality was Step 1 before improving it. Couldn't find a simple
tool for this, so I made one.

pip install agenteval

GitHub: [link]
Quick demo: [GIF]

Would love feedback! Especially if you spot issues or have ideas. 🙏

P.S. It's MIT licensed - use it however you want!

## 🎯 Comparison: Old vs New Timeline

| Metric | OLD (Cold DMs) | NEW (Credibility) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Week 1 Interviews** | 0-1 | 0 (building) |
| **Week 2 Interviews** | 1-2 | 0 (launching) |
| **Week 3 Interviews** | 2-3 | 3-5 |
| **Week 4 Interviews** | 1-2 | 7-10 |
| **Total by Week 4** | 4-8 | 10-15 |
| **Response Rate** | 10-15% | 30-40% |
| **Interview Quality** | Medium | High |
| **Community Goodwill** | None | Strong |
| **Launch Foundation** | Weak | Strong |
| **Long-term Value** | Low | High |

**The Trade:**
- ⚠️ 2 weeks delay to first interviews
- ✅ 2-3x MORE interviews total
- ✅ 3-4x BETTER quality
- ✅ Foundation for product launch

**Worth it?** Absolutely! 🎯

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Risk: AgentEval Takes Too Long to Build

**Mitigation:**
- Keep scope SMALL (MVP only)
- 80/20 rule (good enough > perfect)
- Can hire contractor if needed ($500-1K)
- Worst case: Simple version still provides value

### Risk: Community Doesn't Like AgentEval

**Mitigation:**
- Solve real problem (benchmarking pain exists)
- Make it genuinely useful (not just marketing)
- Open source = forgivable if not perfect
- Iterate based on feedback fast

### Risk: 2-Week Delay Hurts Momentum

**Mitigation:**
- Delay is INVESTMENT not waste
- Better data in Week 3-4 than Week 1-2
- Community goodwill pays off for years
- Can still make GO/NO-GO by Week 4

---

## ✅ Action Items (Next 48 Hours)

**TODAY:**
- [ ] Read AgentEval-Tool-Specification.md fully
- [ ] Decide: Build yourself or hire contractor?
- [ ] If building: Start core evaluator.py (3-4 hours)
- [ ] If hiring: Post on Upwork ($500-1K, 1 week delivery)

**TOMORROW:**
- [ ] Continue AgentEval development
- [ ] Post ONE helpful thing in #talking-shop
- [ ] Engage with 2-3 existing discussions

**DAY 3-7:**
- [ ] Finish AgentEval MVP
- [ ] Polish documentation
- [ ] Prepare launch assets
- [ ] Stay engaged in Slack naturally

## 🎁 The Long Game

**This is not just about 20 interviews.**

**This is about:**
- ✅ Becoming a recognized community member
- ✅ Building trust before selling
- ✅ Creating open-source credibility
- ✅ Establishing thought leadership
- ✅ Foundation for AgentGym launch success

**2 weeks of patience = 2 years of payoff** 🚀

1. Build AgentEval yourself (I'll guide you step-by-step)
2. Hire a contractor (I'll write the spec/posting)
3. Do both (you start, contractor helps finish)

What's your call? 🎯
