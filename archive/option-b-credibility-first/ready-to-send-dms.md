## 🔥 DM #1 - AgentHub Solo Dev (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**To:** [Find their Slack handle from #i-made-this post about AgentHub]
**When:** Send TODAY

```
Hey! 👋

Saw your AgentHub post in #i-made-this - really cool vision for no-code agent teams! The workflow automation angle is exactly what I'm researching.

Quick question: How do you currently handle improving agent quality/accuracy as users build more complex workflows? Curious if you're doing any training beyond prompt tweaking.

I'm interviewing folks building production agent platforms - would love to hear about your experience. 20 mins, just research, no pitch!

Got time this week? Here's my calendar: [YOUR CALENDLY LINK]

Cheers!
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you read their post
- Asks about their specific challenge (quality/training)
- Positions you as researcher, not seller
- Easy call-to-action

## 🔥 DM #2 - Watchflow Team (GitHub Agents)

**To:** [Find their handle from Watchflow post]
**When:** Send TODAY

```
Hey! 👋

Really impressed by Watchflow - using LangGraph agents for PR violation detection is such a smart use case!

Saw you mentioned it's "not yet production-hardened" - curious how you're approaching improving the agent's reasoning quality as you scale?

I'm doing research on how teams train/improve production agents. Would love to chat about your workflow - 20 mins, just learning, no sales pitch!

Interested? Grab time here: [YOUR CALENDLY LINK]

Also happy to jump on the repo as a contributor if helpful 😊

Cheers!
```

**Why this works:**
- Compliments their work specifically
- References their own words ("production-hardened")
- Offers value (contributor) = not just taking
- Technical enough to show you understand

## 🔥 DM #3 - Memory Layer Developer (Multi-Year Experience)

**To:** [Find handle from memory layer post]
**When:** Send TODAY

```
Hey! 👋

Your memory layer project really resonated - I've heard "RAG is inaccurate for specific lookups" from so many agent builders!

Quick question: After building chatbots/agents for years, how do you typically improve agent performance when prompt engineering stops working? Curious what your workflow looks like.

I'm researching exactly this problem (training/improving production agents). Would love 20 mins to learn from your experience - no pitch, just research!

Free this week? [YOUR CALENDLY LINK]

P.S. Your docs look great! 🔥

Cheers!
```

**Why this works:**
- Validates their pain point
- Asks about their specific expertise (years of experience)
- Compliments their docs (builds rapport)
- Clear that you're learning from them

## 🟢 DM #4 - Semantic Search Improver (BACKUP)

**To:** [Find handle from "White Dress" search problem]
**When:** Send TOMORROW if top 3 don't respond

```
Hey! 👋

Saw your question about improving semantic search - the "White Dress" example is so relatable! 😅

Out of curiosity: When you need to improve agent/search quality, what's your go-to approach? Prompt tweaking? Different embeddings? Or do you explore training options?

I'm researching how devs improve their agents in production. Would love to hear your thoughts - 20 mins, just curious, no sales!

Got time? [YOUR CALENDLY LINK]

Cheers!

## 🟢 DM #5 - Multiagent Performance Optimizer (BACKUP)

**To:** [Find handle from "make system faster" post]
**When:** Send TOMORROW

```
Hey! 👋

Saw you're working on speeding up your multiagent system. Performance optimization for agents is such a common challenge!

Quick question: Beyond making it faster, do you have a workflow for improving agent accuracy/quality over time? Or is that still manual prompt engineering?

I'm researching how teams train & improve production agents. Would love 20 mins to learn from your setup - no pitch, just curious!

Interested? [YOUR CALENDLY LINK]

Cheers!
