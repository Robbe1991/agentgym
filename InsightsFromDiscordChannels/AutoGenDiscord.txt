2. This is a big update. It has been two years since we launched the first open-source version of AutoGen. We have made 98 releases, 3,776 commits and resolved 2,488 issues. Our project has grown to 50.4k stars on GitHub and a contributor base of 559 amazing people. Notably, we pioneered the multi-agent orchestration paradigm that is now widely adopted in many other agent frameworks. At Microsoft, we have been using AutoGen and Semantic Kernel in many of our research and production systems, and we have added significant improvements to both frameworks. For a long time, we have been asking ourselves: how can we create a unified framework that combines the best of both worlds? Today we are excited to announce that AutoGen and Semantic Kernel are merging into a single, unified framework under the name Microsoft Agent Framework: [https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework "https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework"). It takes the simple and easy-to-use multi-agent orchestration capabilities of AutoGen, and combines them with the enterprise readiness, extensibility, and rich capabilities of Semantic Kernel. Microsoft Agent Framework is designed to be the go-to framework for building agent-based applications, whether you are a researcher or a developer. For current AutoGen users, you will find that Microsoft Agent Framework's single-agent interface is almost identical to AutoGen's, with added capabilities such as conversation thread management, middleware, and hosted tools. The most significant change is a new workflow API that allows you to define complex, multi-step, multi-agent workflows using a graph-based approach. Orchestration patterns such as sequential, parallel, Magentic and others are built on top of this workflow API. We have created a migration guide to help you transition from AutoGen to Microsoft Agent Framework: [https://aka.ms/autogen-to-af](https://aka.ms/autogen-to-af "https://aka.ms/autogen-to-af").

AutoGen will still be maintained -- it has a stable API and will continue to receive critical bug fixes and security patches -- but we will not be adding significant new features to it. As maintainers, we have deep appreciation for all the work AutoGen contributors have done to help us get to this point. We have learned a ton from you -- many important features in AutoGen were contributed by the community. We would love to continue working with you on the new framework. For more details, read our announcement blog post: [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/ "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/").

    Hi @everyone, I'm working on an agent-based solution using AutoGen and need some guidance. I'm trying to access data from my MCP server, which is hosted on an Azure Function which I build as a mcp server and defined some tools over there. To complete tasks, the MCP server requires credentials like an API key and an Azure Search endpoint means my .env credentials. Could anyone suggest the best way to securely pass these credentials from my AutoGen code to the MCP server? Any examples or best practices would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

    Is the current GraphFlow capable of doing A -> B -> C -> loop back to A and continuing? Currently GraphFlow will lead to both the first node and the end one at the same time, even if I set another activation group.

    also for treeorchestrator, it would iMo, be more a implementation suggestion for graphflow pattern, to provide other forms MCLATS etc i guess (don't hesite to correct me etc ! ) (edited)Tuesday, July 15, 2025 8:25 PM

    I have a general question regarding my first mcp project, I have 3 agents - planner, image upload and playwright agent (mcp, uses create\_mcp\_server\_session). I am using gpt-4.1 and I can run my workflow, however my issue is that it takes over 55K input and 5K output tokens to complete my very basic workflow of navigating to [https://example.com/](https://example.com/ "https://example.com/") and taking a screenshot and uploading it to a cloud storage. Is there a better way of defining my workflow in general? I was expecting fewer input tokens in general as its just a single image. Also it does not like using gpt-4-1-mini for some reason - it times out for me... This is my code: [https://gist.github.com/pavlovmilen/757729e42c947c0b133a9aa4159badc5](https://gist.github.com/pavlovmilen/757729e42c947c0b133a9aa4159badc5 "https://gist.github.com/pavlovmilen/757729e42c947c0b133a9aa4159badc5") Any suggestions would be appreciated ![🙂](https://discord.com/assets/0424e06a82d250e2.svg)

    when i look at the updates of autogen and ag2, it feels like even though there are more contributors to normal autogen, that ag2 is pushing far more features. am i wrong?

    Is the current GraphFlow capable of doing A -> B -> C -> loop back to A and continuing? Currently GraphFlow will lead to both the first node and the end one at the same time, even if I set another activation group.

    It should go back to A, but if your graph is terminated then it won't. Could you add a node before finally terminating the graph?

    thank you, it works as expected. i was unsure about the condition in the edge one as i initially thought it would terminate if the string is the same, however i see that is not the case after testing (e.g. APPROVE and DISAPPROVE would trigger simultaneously because one contains the other's word). I wish the documentation was clear on this though.

    Hi, I’m not sure if this is actually an issue, so I’m hoping a developer could help clarify this for me. When I tried running `python/samples/agentchat_fastapi`, I encountered an error after following the instructions in `README.md`, which says that datetime cannot be serialized. After checking, I found that the problem is caused by the use of the `model_dump()` function, which by default returns a Python object instead of a JSON-serializable one. Reference: [https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.11/api/base\_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model\_dump](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.11/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_dump "https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.11/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_dump") Could this be considered a bug that should be fixed? or is there something wrong with my configuration and operation? It seems like a very simple fix — just changing `model_dump()` to `model_dump(mode="json")` solves the issue. Base on `python 3.12 `(edited)Tuesday, July 22, 2025 11:53 PM

    What's the direction for this product? I have been using it and find it amazing at orchestrating multi agent workflows. I mentioned this to a Data and AI ATS at Microsoft recently and he pushed me down the path of semantic-kernel instead (which is still way behind). Can we safely use this to develop agents for production use..

    It’s open source… like most of Python ecosystem. The narrative you are given is so counterproductive I am sorry. I believe what they meant is if you want to get product support and guarantee on maintenance then you should use Semantic Kernel. AutoGen is community support only — we will often ask you to submit PR fixes for issues you identified. That said we (us and Semantic Kernel developers) are working on something new that will have all the great features of the current AutoGen — it’s like AutoGen 1.0. Most importantly it will also improve the workflow API, and have a complete deployment story. We will provide migration paths for existing AutoGen and Semantic Kernel users. Can’t comment on timeline right now. (edited)Friday, July 25, 2025 4:05 PM

    Which open model running locally can achieve similar performance as hosted models? When it’s hosted, it’s not free. Currently, the most accessible options are still cloud hosted models. If we use open models, it takes much longer time to setup than signing up for hosted services (edited)Sunday, August 3, 2025 1:38 AM

    It’s open source… like most of Python ecosystem. The narrative you are given is so counterproductive I am sorry. I believe what they meant is if you want to get product support and guarantee on maintenance then you should use Semantic Kernel. AutoGen is community support only — we will often ask you to submit PR fixes for issues you identified. That said we (us and Semantic Kernel developers) are working on something new that will have all the great features of the current AutoGen — it’s like AutoGen 1.0. Most importantly it will also improve the workflow API, and have a complete deployment story. We will provide migration paths for existing AutoGen and Semantic Kernel users. Can’t comment on timeline right now. (edited)Friday, July 25, 2025 4:05 PM

    Hello I have small question (no need to go in detail i understand) but on this something , does it will be more based on the semantic kernel framework or more ""shapefull/shapeless""" kind from Autogen ? or it would be a breaking change new product that would be for example something different like: focus on a markdown declaration for the agent , and that would focus on plan action memory, with built-in runtime cloud friendly and be interoperable compatible with other agentic framework using A2A for example ?

    It won’t be a different kind of product. Look and feel will be much simplified than SK and with better integration and production support than AG. It will work across the azure ecosystem in terms of deployment, specification and integration. Much of the work we have been doing is to remove duplication and build a coherent experience for developers. (edited)Wednesday, August 6, 2025 3:06 PM

    Again, AG has always been supported by the community, just like many other open source projects. I invest significant chunk of my time on this while working on other things. I want to be transparent about what I can do and the limit of my effort so you don’t get caught in surprise. The new framework will be a different beast.

One thing I wanted to start was adding sarif support to the filesurfer: [https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-tools/blob/main/sarif/sarif\_file.py](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-tools/blob/main/sarif/sarif_file.py "https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-tools/blob/main/sarif/sarif_file.py") I can code but I'm not fantastic, for me it is also a side project and I'm worried about commiting time.

    What's the direction for this product? I have been using it and find it amazing at orchestrating multi agent workflows. I mentioned this to a Data and AI ATS at Microsoft recently and he pushed me down the path of semantic-kernel instead (which is still way behind). Can we safely use this to develop agents for production use..

    You can always make an OpenAI wrapper easily with python or upload you model to Ollama and use the Ollama OllamaChatCompletionClient

    We are accepting contributions. Though for major architecture changes would be great to use an extension package that you manage as a start so people who are interested can try it out first without getting block by the review process, which can take very long. Given the upcoming rewrite of the framework internal, it may be good for your to first experiment with the current AG and then porting that to the new version.

     Two more weeks ![🙁](https://discord.com/assets/9999d977e14a0d5a.svg) . No hints in the meantime ![😜](https://discord.com/assets/c1923f950530938d.svg)? Will it be helpful to learn the python version of 0.4 first, or is the C# version quite different?

     It’s gonna be different — better in my opinion than the 0.4 dotnet version, which is quite minimal. The new version will introduce a complete overhaul of the dotnet version with agents as well as multi-agents

     Hey All! I am building a single agent system that has a set of `Tool`s as well as interacts with different MCPs for tool definitions. I want the agent to be able to choose between a collection of tools made up of the `Tool`s I have defined as well as the ones exposed by MCPs. I am currently trying to hack `McpWorkbench` into letting me do that, but the tool shapes are different and I am unsure of how autogen interprets the different shapes under the hood... so I wanted to ask for some advice. Does anybody have an example where I can achieve my desired goal? (edited)Monday, September 22, 2025 3:12 AM

     yeh, this sounds like the way to go. I think the part that threw me off is the first statement for workbench in the docs "A Workbench provides a collection of tools that share state and resources." None of my tools share state AND not all of my tools share a resource. Therefore, it didn't seem useful. But looking at the actually api docs.... it starts off with "A workbench is a component that provides a set of tools that **may&#x20;**&#x73;hare resources and state." Updating the docs to reflect the latter statement may be less confusing for peeps.

     Hi Community, I am Bobur, one of the creators of [Memori](https://github.com/GibsonAI/memori "Memori

     (https://github.com/GibsonAI/memori)") OSS memory engine. Memori plugs into the SQL databases (Postgres, MySQL, and others) you already use. With a single line of code `memori.enable()` any LLM gains the ability to remember conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain context across sessions. I created an example with AutoGen. Please check this out and let me know your feedback: [https://github.com/Boburmirzo/autogen-multi-agent-memory](https://github.com/Boburmirzo/autogen-multi-agent-memory "https://github.com/Boburmirzo/autogen-multi-agent-memory")

     I think we need to figure out in what application scenarios using A2A makes sense, and work our way back to introducing it to the framework.

     @everyone This is a big update. It has been two years since we launched the first open-source version of AutoGen. We have made 98 releases, 3,776 commits and resolved 2,488 issues. Our project has grown to 50.4k stars on GitHub and a contributor base of 559 amazing people. Notably, we pioneered the multi-agent orchestration paradigm that is now widely adopted in many other agent frameworks. At Microsoft, we have been using AutoGen and Semantic Kernel in many of our research and production systems, and we have added significant improvements to both frameworks. For a long time, we have been asking ourselves: how can we create a unified framework that combines the best of both worlds? Today we are excited to announce that AutoGen and Semantic Kernel are merging into a single, unified framework under the name Microsoft Agent Framework: [https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework "https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework"). It takes the simple and easy-to-use multi-agent orchestration capabilities of AutoGen, and combines them with the enterprise readiness, extensibility, and rich capabilities of Semantic Kernel. Microsoft Agent Framework is designed to be the go-to framework for building agent-based applications, whether you are a researcher or a developer. For current AutoGen users, you will find that Microsoft Agent Framework's single-agent interface is almost identical to AutoGen's, with added capabilities such as conversation thread management, middleware, and hosted tools. The most significant change is a new workflow API that allows you to define complex, multi-step, multi-agent workflows using a graph-based approach. Orchestration patterns such as sequential, parallel, Magentic and others are built on top of this workflow API. We have created a migration guide to help you transition from AutoGen to Microsoft Agent Framework: [https://aka.ms/autogen-to-af](https://aka.ms/autogen-to-af "https://aka.ms/autogen-to-af").

     AutoGen will still be maintained -- it has a stable API and will continue to receive critical bug fixes and security patches -- but we will not be adding significant new features to it. As maintainers, we have deep appreciation for all the work AutoGen contributors have done to help us get to this point. We have learned a ton from you -- many important features in AutoGen were contributed by the community. We would love to continue working with you on the new framework.

     Sounds good. May I ask, which one will you suggest if for the research purposes? Such as autonomous multi agent systems….

     I will certainly suggest Agent Framework (AF). It’s got the whole company behind it now — not just some random researchers doing it

     If I implement a new OrleansExecution based on InProcessExecution, would that be sufficient to distribute these agents across grains?

     Does anyone know an MCP server or framework that allows my agent to generate Matplotlib- or Seaborn-style plots (lines, bars, distributions, heatmaps, etc.)? Ideally, it should return a ready-to-display image (for example, a PNG).

     LIke @ekzhu mentioned, AutoGen will still be maintained, and you can think of agent framework as a major revision of AutoGen with improvements. Its the same maintainers from AutoGen that are also putting working on Agent Framework and you should see alot of similarities with AutoGen. Below are my top 3 improvement areas that make agent framework a good candidate for your next new project.

     * **Middleware** - write routines that control agent/app behaviour - before/after model calls, function calls, agent runs with the ability to intercept, update data etc. This is critical for security, logging, RAI applications. AutoGen just did not have this.,

     - **Production readiness&#x20;**- this is deeply integrated with Azure Foundry and other services such as openai responses API, Copilot Studio agents etc. You can easily create local agents backed by the Azure AI Agent serve and test them seamlessly. There is also support for deployment for custom workflows on Azure Container apps.,

     -**&#x20;Low level workflow API&#x20;**- many uses want/need an intuitive api that lets them express multi-agent ideas as computational graphs. This is important as it provides control and can improve reliability. The new Workflow API in agent framework makes it quite straightforward to do this. It is similar in spirit to the Graphflow api in autogen but more intuitive (not based on complex broadcast and filtering patterns) For folks who might preview an audio/video overview of the new framework - [https://youtu.be/jyIepE19\_0M?si=1T5napKrOo1SG-I9](https://youtu.be/jyIepE19_0M?si=1T5napKrOo1SG-I9 "https://youtu.be/jyIepE19_0M?si=1T5napKrOo1SG-I9") I also highly recommend the samples folder [https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting\_started](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started "https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started") with examples focused on agents, model clients, evaluation, mcp, middleware, observability, threads, tools, workflows.

     Hello everyone, now that Autogen will not receive any more features I'm evaluating MAF, but I have to say that for Multi-Agent Workflow there is a lot of overhead work as there is no shared chat context anymore, besides your agents, you have to create a lot of structured output classes, executors, agent executors and more just to be able to build the workflow, there are so many things and wrappers, also for memory is not as simple as Autogen. I also find the code really hard to read compared with Autogen that was easy, quick and simple to undertand. As I only used Autogen and Llamaindex before I don't have any experience with Lanchain + Langraph, is it as complex as MAF or is more simple and straight forward as Autogen? If anyone know of any analysis or comparative of easy of use, please let me know. Thank You!!!

   **Built a multi-agent AutoGen 0.4 app that creates YouTube Shorts using Local LLMs \[Tutorial]** Hi everyone! I just finished putting together a beginner-friendly tutorial on the framework. Instead of another "hello world" example, I built something practical - a system where multiple AI agents collaborate to create YouTube Shorts style videos from text prompts. What makes this tutorial different:

   * No complex setup,
   * Shows real-world agent collaboration,
   * Focuses on practical implementation,
   * Starts with official docs example, then builds something useful,
   * Demonstrates JSON response formatting,
   * Actually builds something you can use/modify for your own project,
   * Integrate with Local LLMs using Ollama,

    Interesting, but it doesn't use any teams for multiple-agents. Just routing user requests to predefined agent directly.

    Hi all, wanted to post the project that I've been working on the past few weeks. It's called `kagent`: [https://kagent.dev/](https://kagent.dev/ "https://kagent.dev/"). It's an entirely declarative agent framework, built first and foremost for/on Kubernetes. This project would not have been possible without the amazing work being done on `Autogen`!

    An open-source framework for DevOps and platform engineers to run AI agents in Kubernetes, automating complex operations and troubleshooting tasks.

    Hi everyone, I'm working on a small AutoGen-based side project and wanted to share it here. [autogen-oaiapi](https://github.com/SongChiYoung/autogen-oaiapi "autogen-oaiapi

    (https://github.com/SongChiYoung/autogen-oaiapi)") is a lightweight FastAPI server that wraps an AutoGen team (GroupChat) into an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. PyPI: `pip install autogen-oaiapi`

    * Supports stateless requests with full message history,
    * Reinstantiates the team for each request,
    * `stream=true` is now supported (basic implementation),

    If you've ever wanted to expose your AutoGen team through a standard API interface, this might be useful. Feedback welcome. (edited)Sunday, April 13, 2025 2:30 PM

    Hi ffolks, been working on something a bit fun, to write playlists on Spotify using Autogen: [https://github.com/anshumankmr/sporky](https://github.com/anshumankmr/sporky "https://github.com/anshumankmr/sporky"). Still working on a pilot right now, and will figure out the frontend part apart from a dummy one using Streamlit.

    Hey everyone! Just published a hands-on walkthrough on AutoGen team workflows, breaking down how `RoundRobinGroupChat`, `SelectorGroupChat`, and `Swarm` work. To keep it fun (and simple), I built a team of three agents and asked them to make me a pizza: ![🍕](https://discord.com/assets/9e487a75040f95a5.svg) Dough Chef → Sauce Chef → Toppings Chef → But how they work together depends on the workflow pattern you choose. This video is for anyone building with AutoGen 0.4+ who wants to quickly understand how workflows… work. Check it out here: [https://youtu.be/x8hUgWagSC0](https://youtu.be/x8hUgWagSC0 "https://youtu.be/x8hUgWagSC0") Would love feedback from the community, and I hope that this helps others getting started!

    I’ve seen a questions around model support in AutoGen, so I wrote a short post to clarify how it works - and how you can use custom models today without waiting for official support.

    Hey Guys ![👋](https://discord.com/assets/82c4e269c8f910a4.svg) Curious about something I've been working on that might resonate with many of you here. It's either a dumb or a brilliant idea of how early-stage funding should transform because of AI. As you all know, you can now ship products faster and cheaper than ever. So, what do you think of this next idea: monthly payments for solo-founders for 9-12 mths in exchange for future equity or rev share? On your side you'd only commit to grinding - in other words, to busting your ass developing - so you can focus 100% without juggling day jobs. From the investors' side, they get to back more brilliant minds and diversify their money by investing collectively. I'd love to hear your thoughts as builders, creators - would this be valuable? Is it a fair commitment? If so, what share is ok? If you're interested in the deeper mechanics or want to join the discussion: [https://x.com/slava\_nw/status/191759374220016876](https://x.com/slava_nw/status/191759374220016876 "https://x.com/slava_nw/status/191759374220016876") I shared more details in a thread here: [https://x.com/slava\_nw/status/1917597246381777202](https://x.com/slava_nw/status/1917597246381777202 "https://x.com/slava_nw/status/1917597246381777202")

    [Slava Popkov (@slava\_nw) on X](https://twitter.com/slava_nw/status/1917597246381777202)

    $2.000 - $15.000 Monthly for Solo-founders: vibe-coders, content-makers, researchers or anyone who knows how to use AI to win. in exchange - % of future revenue or equity. Sounds cool? A Thread

    Hi guys, My team created Agentic Radar, a lightweight open-source CLI tool which can visualize your Autogen AgentChat workflows. It shows Agents, Tools, MCP Servers and the overall flow of data through the agentic system. It also scans your workflow for vulnerabilities and provides some mitigations, such as prompt hardening. We just released support for Autogen and will be adding more features to it in the upcoming releases. I have prepared a Google Colab demo, check it out: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14IeJv08lzBsLlEO9cKoHloDioWMWGf5Q?authuser=1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14IeJv08lzBsLlEO9cKoHloDioWMWGf5Q?authuser=1 "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14IeJv08lzBsLlEO9cKoHloDioWMWGf5Q?authuser=1") This is the official repo: [https://github.com/splx-ai/agentic-radar](https://github.com/splx-ai/agentic-radar "https://github.com/splx-ai/agentic-radar") Would greatly appreciate feedback from the community!

    If you are building AI agentic workflows with AutoGen check this website out: [https://agentic-visualizer.splx.ai/](https://agentic-visualizer.splx.ai/ "https://agentic-visualizer.splx.ai/") It creates interactive visualizations of your agentic workflows, showing all the nodes (agents, tools, mcp servers), as well as the overall flow of the data through the system. You can export the graph as an image (for example, to include in your GitHub repo README) or just play around in the web app to get a better grasp of your agentic workflow. It is completely free and simple to use, no sign-up necessary, just paste the URL of your public GitHub repository (or a folder inside it), or upload your code as a ZIP archive. I would love to hear what your thoughts are!

    I built a AutoGen-based multi-agent system that mimics the workflow of a data analyst team, with four agents:

    1. Planner (for understanding the business question),
    2. Python Coder (for writing and running analysis),
    3. Executor (for executing the python code in Docker/Jupyter),
    4. Report Generator (for compiling outputs into simple reports),

    As with many AI use-cases, the early results are promising. With a good prompt and relevant data, the system can operate almost on auto-pilot — and I’d say it performs close to what a ~2-year experience data analyst might do. What I liked about AutoGen:

    1. Ability to define agents; and different models by agent In my case: Planner uses Open AI o4-mini; Python coder uses gpt-4.1 and report generator also uses gpt-4.1,
    2. Flexibility of selector function: I wrote a custom selector function for the agent/analysis loop; this was very helpful,
    3. Human in the loop: Data-analysis is very exploratory; so ability to allow human in the loop as part of the interaction was core,
    4. Shared Memory: I was able to define a simple list (shared memory) between the planner and report generator,
    5. Websocket Interaction: I was able to build a custom UI which interacts with AutoGen over websockets,
    6. DockerJupyter Executor: This was one of the core reasons I started exploring AutoGen; being able to execute python code in a isolated docker was very important for this usecase.,

    Overall, I feel AutoGen really helped me to set this up really quickly - without getting in the way. P.S: Launched it here: [https://www.askprisma.ai/](https://www.askprisma.ai/ "https://www.askprisma.ai/")

    Hi guys, My team created Agentic Radar, a lightweight open-source CLI tool which can visualize your Autogen AgentChat workflows. It shows Agents, Tools, MCP Servers and the overall flow of data through the agentic system. It also scans your workflow for vulnerabilities and provides some mitigations, such as prompt hardening. We just released support for Autogen and will be adding more features to it in the upcoming releases. I have prepared a Google Colab demo, check it out: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14IeJv08lzBsLlEO9cKoHloDioWMWGf5Q?authuser=1](<> "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14IeJv08lzBsLlEO9cKoHloDioWMWGf5Q?authuser=1") This is the official repo: [https://github.com/splx-ai/agentic-radar](<> "https://github.com/splx-ai/agentic-radar") Would greatly appreciate feedback from the community! Thank you!

    Hey everyone, I just finished a new tutorial on how to connect your AutoGen agents to an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. I've been experimenting with this because it's a super clean way to give your agents a whole new set of tools. In the video, I'll basically show you how to use the `autogen-ext[mcp]` package to pull tools from a couple of servers. It's a quick, under-8-minute guide to get you started. Check out the full tutorial here: [https://youtu.be/K6w7wmGKVso](https://youtu.be/K6w7wmGKVso "https://youtu.be/K6w7wmGKVso") Pls share your feedback and happy to answer any questions you have about the setup!
